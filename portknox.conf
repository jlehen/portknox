# still pending actions for the same IP address.
#   - exec: Execute the action(s), as if there was no pending request.
#   - ignore: Ignore the request if there are still pending action(s) from the
#             same IP address.
#   - reset: Reset timer for the pending actions.

# Action line expansion:
#   - %h: IP address from which the request is coming.
#   - %n: Request unique identifier
